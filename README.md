<b>Project name: WolfScheduler</b><br>
WolfScheduler is a project that reads in a list of available courses and allows users to build their semester schedule. 
Furthermore, it doesn’t allow the user to select classes they have already taken, go over a certain number of credits, 
and take classes with conflicting timings.<br>
<b>Technologies used</b>: Eclipse, Java and JUnit<br><br>
<b>Project name: CoffeeShop</b><br>
CoffeeShop is meant to be a restaurant interface that allows the user to select a main course, a side dish, a drink, and sauces. 
Once selected, the interface gives the user the total price calculated with tax and the delivery time.<br>
<b>Technologies used</b>: Eclipse, Java and JUnit<br><br>
<b>Project name: PackHire</b><br>
PackHire is a project that sets the user to apply for an interview. It has different stages, such as Reference Check A and B, 
Interview A and B, Waitlist A and B, and the End state. In each of the interview stages, 
the user must fill out a form and be sent to the waitlist to wait for the next interview. 
The process ends when there are no more interviews to be had, or the user has not passed one of the interviews.<br>
